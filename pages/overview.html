<h1 class="page-header">UX Style Guide</h1>
<p>This guide will provide many examples and usage patterns for the SpotX Publisher Tools.  This guide is also a resource with ongoing updates for patterns introduced in the future. It provides information for those would like to understand and adopt the patterns in their application development.</p>

<p>There are many benefits to adopting the new patterns, among them are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Consistency: one of the benefits of adopting the patterns is making our applications look and feel more consistent. Development with these standard patterns will also be more at home in a variety of settings. Better yet, the time it takes a new user to learn how to manage our applications will be significantly reduced by leveraging these familiar patterns.</li>
	<li>Speed and agility: the new UX patterns have web standards at their core. Applications will load faster and be more compatible with modern browsers. Additionally, the UX patterns allow for improved flexibility when adjusting the interface via CSS without needing to alter the HTML foundation.</li>
	<li>Time-saving: planning and development using these UX patterns can be much easier than doing it from scratch. This guide can help speed up development by leveraging reusable UI components so you can focus on the key features of your development.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are code snippets that can be easily copied to your clipboard throughout the guide. You can toggle the code snippets in the upper right corner of the guide.</p>
