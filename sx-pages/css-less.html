        <legend>::ng-deep (aka. /deep/ and >>>) - depreciated</legend>
        <p>Applying the ::ng-deep pseudo-class to any CSS rule completely disables view-encapsulation for that rule. 
            Any style with ::ng-deep applied becomes a global style. 
            In order to scope the specified style to the current component and all its descendants, 
            be sure to include the :host selector before ::ng-deep. 
            If the ::ng-deep combinator is used without the :host pseudo-class selector, the style can bleed into other components.</p>
        <p>The following example targets all h3 elements, from the host element down through this component to all of its child elements in the DOM.</p>
        <pre rel="CSS" class="language-css">
            <code>
:host ::ng-deep h3 {
    font-style: italic;
}
            </code>
        </pre>

        <legend>PX to REM (coming soon)</legend>
        <p>REMs are a way of setting font-sizes based on the font-size of the root HTML element. They also allow you to quickly scale an entire project by changing the root font-size, for example at a certain media query/screen size.
            “[The REM] unit represents the font-size of the root element (e.g. the font-size of the <html> element). When used on the font-size on this root element, it represents its initial value.”</p>
